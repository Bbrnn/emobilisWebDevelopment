# emobilisWebDevelopment

This repository showcases my learning journey in web development during the Emobilis program. I gained hands-on experience with:  
- **Frontend Development**: HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for responsive and visually appealing designs.  
- **Backend Development**: Django framework for building robust and scalable web applications.  
- **Database Management**: MySQL for storing and managing application data.  
- **API Integration**: Integration of Daraja API for mobile money transactions.  
- **API Testing**: Postman for testing and validating APIs effectively.  

This project highlights my skills in developing full-stack web applications and working with modern web technologies.
